                  <h4>Appreciated Assets</h4>
                  <p>Holdings, such as corporate securities and real estate, that have appreciated in value make great giving assets. The University of Idaho credits you for the full fair-market value of the stock or land, and there are some favorable tax benefits</p>
                
                  <h4>Memorial or Honorary Gifts</h4>

				 <p>In 1962, W. C. Cheney, an inventor from Seattle, WA presented  President Theophilus with 17 55-gallon drum barrels on the condition that the  barrels be opened in 2010.&nbsp; The year 2010 has arrived and the mystery  barrels have been opened.&nbsp;</p>
                  <h4>Who was W. C. Cheney?</h4>
                  <p>W. C. Cheney, circa 1898-circa 1977, earned his living  as a machine shop operator. "With drill and lathe and torch," writes  Rafe Gibbs in his history of the University of Idaho, Beacon for Mountain and  Plain, "Cheney was a master." He also was an inventor who applied his  imagination and skill to many avocations, including astronomy, history, and  photography. </p>
                  <p>Cheney's place of birth has not been identified, but  according to the finding aid for the William Cheney Motion Picture Collection  at the Oregon Historical Society, Cheney was a child in Oregon City, Oregon  when he became interested in photography. As a youth, he discovered astronomy  and mountain climbing. </p>
                  <p>In 1922, Cheney lived in Tillamook. By 1927 he had taken  a wife, whose name is not known, and was living in Oceanside. The couple lived  briefly in Portland before moving to Longview, Washington around 1930. Sometime  in 1933, Mr. and Mrs. Cheney moved to Seattle where he still lived when he  donated his Americana collection to the University of Idaho in 1961. The  specific date and place of his death also are unknown.</p></td>
     
                  <h4>History of the W. C.  Cheney Americana Collection 1900-1960</h4>
                  <p>In March 1961, W. C. Cheney wrote to University of  Idaho President D.R. Theophilus offering a significant - and unusual -  gift.&nbsp; University of Idaho Reports, June  1962  <a style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="/timecapsule/Documents/UI_Reports.pdf">announces</a> the  gift. </p>
                  <p>In his sixties when he wrote to President Theophilus,  W. C. Cheney had operated a machine shop in Seattle, Washington for most  of his life. A machinist by vocation who specialized in manufacturing  custom-built torches, Cheney's avocations were astronomy and history. As an  amateur astronomer, he built his own observatory and the equipment within it.  Cheney's interest in history led him to collect a large volume of textual materials  and material objects that he felt were "an authentic cross section of events"  that occurred during his life.</p>
                  <p>
                    <img src="/timecapsule/images/Picture_01.jpg" alt="" align="right">                   The  textual materials Mr. Cheney gathered were the common information sources of  the first half of 
                    
                    the 20th century, such as newspapers and magazines.  He also collected catalogs; posters; concert programs; calendars; playbills;  restaurant menus; advertisements; and correspondence of all sorts, including  business letters, love notes, and even "junk mail." In addition to the paper  items, Mr. Cheney collected material objects, such as milk bottles, toys, and  tokens. </p>
                  <p>Cheney also preserved historically significant radio  programs and announcements. "On wax (and even on glass during World War II) he  recorded history as it was being made - the landing of Charles Lindbergh in  Paris in 1927;the stock market crash of 1929;the "blood, sweat and tears"  speech of Winston Churchill in World War II;the bombing of Pearl Harbor,"  writes Rafe Gibbs in <a style="font-weight:bold" target="_blank" href="/timecapsule/Documents/Gibbsmerged.pdf">his history of the University of Idaho, <em>Beacon for Mountain and Plain</em></a>. </p>
                  <p>Beginning  in 1960, Cheney began placing the materials he had collected in unique storage  containers:&nbsp; 55-gallon steel drums  formerly used to hold oil. Eventually there were 17 barrels. <img src="/timecapsule/images/barrels.png" width="210" height="312" align="right"></p>
                  <p>The University of Idaho was first on Mr. Cheney's list of  schools to which he would offer his collection, and at their April 1961  meeting, the University's Board of Regents accepted his gift. According to Rafe  Gibbs in <em>Beacon for Mountain and Plain</em>,  Mr. Cheney had selected the University of Idaho, "which he knew only by  reputation," because of the institution's "concern for America's heritage" and  its "desire to build upon it." </p>
                  <p>In accepting the gift, the Regents willingly agreed to  the two stipulations Mr. Cheney specified in his March 16, 1961, letter to  President Theophilus: that the drums "be stored in a clean dry place, and, NOT  OPENED 'TILL 2010." After their receipt, the barrels were stored in the  basement of the University of Idaho Library where they remained undisturbed  until February 2010 when Library staff began processing the collection. </p>
