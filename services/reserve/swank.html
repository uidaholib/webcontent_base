<p>The University of Idaho Library offers support for the Swank Motion Picture streaming movie service. This service offers an extensive catalog of movies and documentaries from most major Hollywood and independent movie studios for classroom use. Licensing through Swank is done on a title-by-title basis, and licenses last for one semester. The library's membership in the Orbis Cascade Alliance enables us to offer this service with the maximum discount on licensing offered by Swank.</p>
<p>The licensing terms offered by Swank are not typical of library resources, and will require individual departments to pay via credit card for each licensed title. The library will coordinate between Swank and the licensing department, but payment will ultimately be the responsibility of the department.</p>
<p>For more information or to set up a license for a video, please contact <a href="mailto:haire@uidaho.edu">Jodi Haire</a>.</p>
