                      <li>Reading lists may be sent separately as an <a href="mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu">email attachment</a>, but the professor will still need to supply copies of the source pages.</li>

                    <h4>Appropriate types of materials for paper (in-library) reserve</h4>

                      <li> Multiple chapters from the same book</li>
                      <li> More than two articles from the same<b> issue</b> of a journal</li>

                      <li>Materials can be used for one semester under provisions of the Fair Use sections of the copyright law. Subsequent use requires that the library purchase rights to re-use the item. In the event that these rights are denied or deemed to be beyond reasonable costs, the library will remove the item from reserve and contact the professor about securing different readings.</li>

                    <h4>Processing Time</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Typically, first come, first served; may, at the discretion of the library, be arranged to serve the largest number of students for the least effort.</li>
                      <li>Plan for two weeks, particularly if you expect the library to scan and/or pull materials.</li>
                      <li>Remember that everyone needs to have his materials available for the first day of the semester. Do not expect this to happen if you have not submitted your material two weeks before the first day of the semester.</li>
                      <li>You will be notified by email when your material is available. At this time, you will be given the password for your students to use to gain access to scanned documents.</li>
                      <li>If you would like to check on the availability of your class, please visit the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/reserve/index.html">Reserve page</a> on our website.</li>
