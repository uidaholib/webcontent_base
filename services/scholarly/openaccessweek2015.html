		  <p>The University of Idaho Library is participating in the <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">8th Annual International Open Access Week</a>, an international celebration of free online access to scholarly research. The week highlights open access resources, institutions, and individuals that work to provide open access to research materials. This year’s “Open for Collaboration” theme highlights the power of openness to drive collaboration and advance research. </p>
		  <p>The “Open for Collaboration” theme will provide an opportunity for Open Access supporters to consider working with those in similar, allied movements for <b><a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/data/">Open Data</a></b> and <b><a href="http://libguides.uidaho.edu/oer">Open Education</a></b> to advance common goals more quickly.</p>
		  <p>Open access literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. In most fields, journals do not pay authors for their work yet make money off of their research while removing all rights the author had to their work. The open access model tries to correct this by creating journals that do not strip authors of their rights while still publishing quality, peer-reviewed research and by educating authors about their options in publishing. You can read an overview of open access by Peter Suber <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm">here</a>, or interact with the resources below.</p>
		  <p>Use this page as a starting point to learn more about open access, open education, Open Access Week events, and how you can advocate for openness at the University of Idaho.</p>

<p><b>What are open educational resources? (OERs)</b></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open educational resources (OERs)</a> are teaching, learning, and research resources that have been released under an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">intellectual property license</a> that permits their free use. OERs include course materials, textbooks, modules, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tool, material or technique used to support teaching and access to knowledge. Open textbooks are high-quality college texts with an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">"open" copyright license</a> allowing the material to be freely accessed, shared and adapted. Open textbooks are typically distributed online at no cost and can be purchased in print formats at a low cost. On average, using open textbooks in place of traditional textbooks save students <a href="http://studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/about">80%</a>. </p>

<p><b>Why use open educational resources?</b></p>
	<p>Every college student knows what it's like to walk into the bookstore and pay $200 for a textbook, or to get pennies back for an expensive book at the end of the term. With today's technology, there's no excuse for textbooks to be so expensive! Textbook prices have skyrocketed four times faster than inflation for the past two decades, and the average UI student spends $1,232 on books and materials each year.</p>
	<p>High textbook costs directly effect student success.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>65% of students report not purchasing required texts due to cost. (Source: <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market">Student PIRGs</a>)</li>
	<li>94% of students who had forgone purchasing a textbook were concerned that doing so would hurt their grade in a course. (Source: <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market">Student PIRGs</a>)</li>
	<li>48% of students take fewer courses due to textbook costs. (Source: <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market">Student PIRGs</a>)</li>
	<li>82% of students felt they would do significantly better in a course if a textbook was available free online and buying a hard copy was optional. (Source: <a href="http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market">Student PIRGs</a>)</li>

  <p><b>I'd like to help; what can I do?</b></p>
  
<p>If you are a faculty member... 
<ul>
<li>Consider submitting your research articles to open access journals when possible. (Don't know if a journal is open access? Visit <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/RoMEO</a>) </li>
<li>Deposit your post-prints in our <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/scholarly/repository.html">Institutional Repository</a> and deposit your data with <a href="https://www.northwestknowledge.net/">NKN</a>. </li>
<li>Encourage other faculty to do the same, especially if you are an administrator. </li>
<li>Consider including open textbooks and other open educational resources in your search for course materials. Student PIRGs has a <a href="http://studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/faculty-statement">faculty statement</a> you can sign to state your intent to seek affordable and accessible course materials whenever possible. The <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/">Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.doceocenter.org/">Doceo Center</a> are resources available for faculty considering open educational resources, and the Library also has <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/scholarly/openaccess.html">many resources on open access publishing</a>.</li></ul></p>

<p>If you are a student...
<ul>
<li>Seek out and use open access resources for your assignments. </li>
<li>Consider showing your support for open access and open education - to faculty, administration, or student government. Student PIRGs has a <a href="http://studentpirgs.org/resources/sp/campus-textbooks-campaign-toolkit">campus textbooks campaign toolkit</a> that can act as a guide for bringing the textbook conversation to campus, and SPARC has a <a href="http://sparc.arl.org/sites/default/files/rr2008_pages.pdf">student guide to opening access to scholarship</a>.</li></ul></p> 

<p>If you are a community member...
<ul>
<li>Consider <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/giving/">supporting</a> the Library and the University as it seeks to create an OER pilot program and initiative.</li></ul></p>
