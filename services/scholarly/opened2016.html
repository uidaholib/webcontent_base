            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Open educational resources are educational materials, like textbooks, released with an open license from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons</a> to allow for the <strong>free use, reuse, revision, remix, and redistribution</strong> of that material. Open textbooks are like a generic version of a brand name prescription – the same ingredients and the same authors without all the marketing, and at a significantly lower cost. Additionally, reclaiming educational content from academic publishers allows for flexibility, customization, and freedom for faculty not found in traditional textbooks.</p>

              <h4 class="panel-title">Affordability</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>The <strong>affordability of a college education matters to all of us at the University of Idaho</strong>, whether we are undergraduates working two part-time jobs to make ends meet, graduate students teaching their very first courses, or veteran faculty members. Affordability is especially important in Idaho, where nearly half of K-12 students are from low-income households.</p>
              <p>While tuition and state appropriations are generally beyond the influence of average librarians and professors, the cost of textbooks is something we can do something about. The average student at a public four-year university spends $1,298 on books and supplies each year, and the cost of textbooks has increased by 812% since 1978. The high cost of textbooks is leading students to go without required books and take fewer courses.</p>
              <p>With 5 major publishers controlling nearly 90% of the textbook market, publishers can raise prices to absurd levels because students are captive consumers – they have to buy whatever books are assigned. It can feel as though these publishers are taking advantage of our systems of higher education by making obscene profits off the backs of struggling students. And we can do better.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>Several faculty at the University of Idaho are <strong>already using open educational resources</strong> to save their students money. Renae Shrum, a Statistics Instructor, has been using an open textbook in her Statistics 251 courses for two years. The textbook she uses, <a href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os">OpenIntro Statistics</a>, is free to access online and available for purchase in print for only $7.60. Since Renae is a recent graduate, she is “hyper-aware” of the costs for students and chose the OpenIntro Statistics book because of its affordability.</p>
              <p>“The students were thrilled at the cost,” she said, and “didn’t mind the format at all.”</p>
              <p>Brian Dennis, another faculty member teaching Statistics, uses the same open textbook in his Statistics 251 courses. As Brian was selecting his materials for a course in the fall, he found the prices for popular statistics textbooks “horrifying.”</p>
              <p>“I knew there were free statistics resources out there,” he said, “and after a quick search this one popped out at me.” Professor Dennis found the book to be quite serviceable and has used it in two courses. He’s received no negative comments from students, but lots of enthusiasm about the affordability.</p>
