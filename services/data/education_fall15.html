						<td>Managing and Cultivating a Digital Media Presence as an Academic</td>
						<td style="font-size: 85%;">Are you aware of your online and digital presence? What do you find when you Google yourself – is it what you want to see? What will other people, including hiring committees, make of you after encountering the digital version of you?  There is no way to avoid leaving a digital footprint these days, and many current faculty have embraced the multitude of social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc.) to share their research, their thoughts, and their personal opinions. But what is the best advice for grad students and junior faculty members when it comes to managing and cultivating a professional and helpful digital presence?  Join us for a discussion and demonstration of practical social media tools and resources for an active digital presence. This workshop will encourage participants to engage with social media, so please bring laptops, tablets, smart phones, etc. to the event.  <span style="text-align: right;"><a href="registration.html">Click to Register</a></span></td>

						<td>Solve Problems, Save Time:  Making Data Management Work for You (I)</td>
						<td style="font-size: 85%;">Data management planning is an increasingly useful skill for improving research process efficiency and meeting obligations of funding agencies.  During these two sessions, we will focus on developing NSF-style data management plans.  Among the topics addressed will be thinking about how to introduce data management activities into the research workflow, how to document and describe your research products, share them in repositories, and get credit for your hard work with digital object identifiers (DOIs). Additionally, we will cover how to address tricky questions such as long-term storage, archiving, and dissemination strategies.  Attendees should plan to come away with a data management plan draft for their own current or proposed research.  <span style="text-align: right;"><a href="registration.html">Click to Register</a></span></td>
