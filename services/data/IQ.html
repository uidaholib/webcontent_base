              <p>The IQ-station, which stands for <a href="http://iq.nkn.uidaho.edu/" style="font-size:larger; "><strong>I</strong>nexpensive <strong>I</strong>nteractive <strong>I</strong>mmersive <strong>I</strong>nterface</a>, is a virtual  reality tool by which University of Idaho researchers can interact with complex datasets in three dimensions.  The University of Idaho library's version uses a 73-inch, 3D television combined with two computers, monitors, and six tracking cameras to enable three dimensional effects.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>An IQ-station user  wears a pair of 3D glasses that allow him/her to perceive the screen projections, along with a controller -- which looks and functions much like a  PlayStation 3 controller -- that is tracked by the system and allows a user to drive the experience, i.e. to manipulate and move different aspects of the  visualization as well as to change his/her own perspective within the field.</p>
               
              <p>The IQ-station renders specific types of datasets into three dimensional visualizations that a user can explore and analyze.&nbsp; Currently, the machine is equipped with a  number of demonstration datasets, including LIDAR and MRI. To explore ones own dataset, a user must import the data using a thumbdrive or other external hard drive device; the data must also be of a type that the software currently loaded on the system can render.</p>
