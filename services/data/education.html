						<td>Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon</td>
						<td style="font-size: 85%;">This workshop will provide an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to fact-check and enhance current Wikipedia articles related to the University of Idaho by using archival materials and special collections found in the Library. Wikipedia edit-a-thons improve and generate content using and linking back to the institutional holdings at the library, demonstrating how open educational materials can be used, revised, and redistributed while engaging with the unique collections at the University of Idaho. The event is open to the public and no specialized knowledge or Wikipedia editing experience is required. A brief overview of the basics of Wikipedia editing will be given at the start of the edit-a-thon. We will have library resources and a list of suggested topics on hand.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/UI/Edit-a-thon">More event information.</a>  <span style="text-align: right;"><a href="registration.html">Click to Register</a></span></td>

						<td>Introducing Jupyter Notebook for Python and R</td>
						<td style="font-size: 85%;">Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.org/) is a powerful tool for writing, using, and sharing code, perfect for academic teaching and learning. For researchers using Python and other languages, it is an efficient interface to iteratively explore data, present live code to students, or share data driven visualizations with colleagues. If you are just getting started with programming, it is also a great interactive environment for learning and prototyping code.  This workshop will introduce the unique features that code notebooks offer to researchers and students. Participants will learn how to install and use Jupyter with the IPython and R kernels. Intended for: students, faculty, and staff interested in learning about code notebooks, sharing code, or learning to code.  Complete beginners interested in learning about programming with Python are welcome and encouraged to attend!  <span style="text-align: right;"><a href="registration.html">Click to Register</a></span></td>

						<td>Communicating Your Research Through Story Maps</td>
						<td style="font-size: 85%;">Story Maps are a new method of communicating spatial information by combining narratives, images, videos, and other forms of digital content around maps.   They have proven effective in providing a low barrier to telling a compelling map-oriented story.  Using ArcGIS Online - available to all at UI - we will show you how to access and create a Story Map using both shared online data as well as how to upload your own.  No GIS background is necessary to get started, although it can be helpful.  <span style="text-align: right;"><a href="registration.html">Click to Register</a></span></td>
