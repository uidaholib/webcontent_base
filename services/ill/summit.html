						<h4 >Placing requests for Summit materials will become much easier beginning January 20th.</h4> <p>When you find an item you want to borrow in <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu">Primo</a> (using the "UI and Summit" search), simply log in to your library account, click on the "Place Summit Request" link, and you'll be presented with a brief request form. Select your pick-up location (and enter volume info, if necessary), then click Submit. That's it!
</p>
<p>
It will also be easier to check the status of your Summit requests. You will now see them listed in your My Library account under the Requests tab. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to see if an item is available at other Summit libraries, click on the "More" link under the Find It tab.  You don't need to check the availability if you're simply placing a Summit request - you'll be notified if we can't fulfill your request.  
</p>

The external Summit catalog (summit.worldcat.org) will no longer be available after January 20th  either. If you prefer searching in Worldcat, you can find a link to Worldcat on our <a href="/find/articles.html">Databases</a> page.</p>

				<p>Summit is a resource sharing service that provides access to print materials and media from 37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho. This service is available free of charge to any currently-enrolled student, staff, or faculty member (current and emeritus) with a valid UI account. Summit works hand-in-hand with your pre-existing circulation account, so no special registration is required.</p>
				
				<p>Summit utilizes a courier service that delivers materials within <b>3-5 business days</b>. This makes it a faster and less expensive alternative to Interlibrary Loan. This is why <b>Summit is our preferred method for requesting materials that the UI Library does not own</b>.</p>

				<p>Summit requesting is mainly for books, although many Alliance libraries also lend special materials like DVDs and CDs. Books have a loan period of <b>42 days</b>, while media materials check out for <b>6 days</b>. Renewals are not allowed for any materials requested through Summit.</p>
				
				<p><ol>
				<li>First locate the item you want in Primo using the �UI and Summit (no articles)� search option</li>
				<li>Click on the Find It tab for the desired item and sign in to your library account using your 
Vandalweb username and password information.
</li>
				<li>If you want to check if an item is available at other Summit libraries, click on the �More� link.  </li>
			<li>To initiate a Summit request, click on the �Place Summit Request� button.</li>
				<li>Select the appropriate pickup location, enter specific volume information as needed, and then select OK.</li>
				<li>You can monitor the status of the request under your My Library account.</li>
				<li>If the request cannot be filled through Summit, you will receive a cancellation email which will redirect you to Interlibrary Loan instead.</li>
				<li>If the request is successful, you will receive an email from the circulation desk once the item is available for pickup. Off-campus patrons will have items shipped directly to them by mail.</li>
