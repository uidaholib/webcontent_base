        <p>As a land grant university, the University of Idaho (UI) seeks to “shape the future through innovative thinking” and “expand the institution’s intellectual and economic impact.”<sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>The UI-OAPF supports this vision by making the innovative research conducted at UI as widely accessible as possible.</p>

        <p>Supporting open access models of publication demonstrates that UI embraces equity of access, which is a catalyst for increased impact and visibility throughout the state, nation, and beyond.</p>

        <p>For the pilot year (FY 19), the fund partners have allocated $30,000 to pay article processing charges (APCs) in eligible open access journals.</p>

        <p>Applications that meet all eligibility criteria, including article and author caps, are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis starting July 1, 2018 until funds are exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.</p>
