    <p>As a land grant university, the University of Idaho (UI) seeks to “shape the future through innovative thinking” and “expand the institution’s intellectual and economic impact.”<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>The UI-OAPF supports this vision by making the innovative research conducted at UI as widely accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Supporting open access models of publication demonstrates that UI embraces equity of access, which is a catalyst for increased impact and visibility throughout the state, nation, and beyond.</p>

<p>Open access and the UI-OAPF also tie into the University of Idaho Strategic Plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Goal 1 – Innovate</em>: Heighten the visibility of the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.</li>
  <li><em>Goal 2 – Engage</em>: Reduce barriers related to accessing the University of Idaho’s research, innovation, scholarship, and creative works.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the pilot year (FY 19), the fund partners have allocated $30,000 to pay article processing charges (APCs) in eligible open access journals.</p>

<p>Applications that meet all eligibility criteria, including article and author caps, are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis starting July 1, 2018 until funds are exhausted or the end of the fiscal year.</p>
