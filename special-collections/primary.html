              <p>Access to the manuscripts and archival material in the library is primarily
provided by the <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?menuitem=0&fromTop=true&fromPreferences=false&fromEshelf=false&vid=UID">online catalog</a>. Descriptive entries identify the persons,
places, and things of prominence in the collection. Larger bodies of material
frequently have supplementary inventories and descriptive guides, whose
presence is also noted in the catalog. Kept in stack areas closed to public access, and frequently
measured in the hundreds of cubic feet, these primary source materials
are delivered to the reading room by knowledgeable staff upon request.
</p>
              <p>Students, faculty, visiting scholars, and members of the public with
research inquiries are welcome to consult the personal papers and university
archives in the Special Collections Department of the University of Idaho
Library. Special Collections materials are non-circulating. Their use is
limited to the Special Collections reading room during regular <a href="visiting.html">hours</a>.
</p>
              <p>Because of the often times fragile or unique character of the materials
in Special Collections, great care must be taken in their use. For this
reason, the collection is non-circulating. Photocopying is available but
can be permitted only when it will not harm the material and is permitted
by federal copyright law. Smoking, eating, drinking and the use of pens
are all prohibited in the reading room. Users of the materials must register
upon entering the Special Collections Department. A knowledgeable staff
and a variety of finding aids are available to assist researchers and retrieve
materials for study.</p>
