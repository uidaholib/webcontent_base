<p >The Special Collections Department of the University of Idaho Library includes
those materials that, because of subject coverage, rarity, source, condition, or form, are best handled separately from the General Collection. The several "collections" housed in this department are for research use by faculty, students, and visiting scholars. However, the materials are non-circulating; their use is limited to the Special Collections <a href="/special-collections/rules.html">Reading Room</a>, which is open 9am-4pm, Monday through Friday (Summer hours: 10am - 2pm Monday through Friday, or by appointment).</p>
<p>Access to the materials is provided primarily by the <a href="http://search.lib.uidaho.edu">library's catalog</a>. A knowledgeable <a href="contactus.html">staff</a> and a variety of finding aids are available to assist researchers and retrieve materials for study.</p>
