	<p>Please call at 208-885-5813 or email <a href="mailto:libspec@uidaho.edu">libspec@uidaho.edu</a> to discuss the donation of archives, personal papers, photographs, and/or select publications. Those that relate to the history, culture and environment of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest region are received into our Special Collections & Archives, while the International Jazz Collections welcomes personal papers of jazz musicians and critics. The University Archives specializes in the history of the University of Idaho.</p>
	<p>Special Collections & Archives provides researchers with supervised access to collections in a public reading room. Collections are processed by trained staff and stored in archival containers in a high security environment. Digital access to archival finding guides and to some individual photographs and documents is available through the University of Idaho Library website on the <a href="description.html">Collections</a> page.</p>
	<p>Archival collections frequently need cash donations to enable timely processing and underwrite the costs of long-term high security storage. Such funds are used to organize, maintain, and care for our collections so that they may be preserved and made available for future generations. Examples of how direct funding may be used include:
	<ul>
	<li>Hiring additional staff for large-scale projects.</li>
	<li>Purchase of acid-free folders and boxes.</li>
	<li>Conservation or preservation of fragile materials.</li>
	<li>Purchases of research collections or specific books. Many collections and books are donated to the Library each year, but there is an ongoing need to buy rare or uniquely significant pieces to match the needs of our users.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>All materials purchased by Special Collections & Archives are acquired through gift funds from the Library Associates (Friends of the Library group), and other donors. Gifts may be used to honor an individual, a family, a company, or an organization, and the Library will work with donors to employ appropriate means to publicly acknowledge donations. To discuss setting up endowments or bequests, please contact Lynn Baird, Dean of University of Idaho Library, at <a href="mailto:lbaird@uidaho.edu">lbaird@uidaho.edu</a> or 208-885-6534. More information is also available on the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/giving/">Giving website</a>.</p>
	<p>A useful leaflet covering many donor and institutional concerns has been published by the Society of American Archivists. It is <a href="http://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/donating-familyrecs">"A Guide to Donating Your Personal or Family Papers to a Repository."</a></p>
