              <h1>Forestry Collection Inventories</h1>
			  <p>Special Collections and Archives contains a vast amount of forestry related information. We are also currently building a forestry portal to better organize and present our many digital collections related to forestry resources, such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/expforest/">Experimental Forest and Savenac Nursery Photo Archive</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/spec_pot">Family Tree Collection</a>, and the <a href="http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/plcphotos">Potlatch Lumber Company Photograph Collection</a> </p>
<div class="center"><a id="popover1" type="button" class="btn btn-default spec-btn" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-html="true"   data-content="
 
<p>  Each individual collection has a title and number, which are used to organize and reference the collection. Number prefixes show to which Collection group a particular archival, manuscript or photograph collection is assigned. For example, 10 stands for Manuscript Group 10, WILLIAM EDGAR BORAH, 1865-1940. </p>
<p><b>MG</b> signifies <b>Manuscript Group</b>, for Manuscript and Archival collections.</p>
<p><b>UG</b> signifies <b>University Group</b>, for University Archives records and documents.</p>
<p><b>PG</b> signifies <b>Photograph Group</b>, for for Historic Photograph collections.</p>

Understanding Our Collections

<a id="popover2" type="button" class="btn btn-default spec-btn" data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-html="true"   data-content="
  <p>Below is a searchable and sortable table listing collections by title, group number, and resource links. The links point to a finding aid, which is a description of the collection and what it contains. In cases where that collection has been digitized, a link to a digital collection is also included.</p>
