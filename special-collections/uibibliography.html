             <h2>The History of the University of Idaho; a bibliography</H2>

<P>
A 100-year-old multi-faceted institution naturally has many diverse
stories to tell. A history of this university can be quickly
scanned or any small portion can be savored in great depth. The
place to start learning about the path that has lead us to where
we are today is the two comprehensive histories of the University
of Idaho. Keith Petersen's <I>This Crested Hill</I> is the official
centennial pictorial history with an excellent narrative and bibliography.
Rafe Gibb's <I>Beacon for Mountain and Plain</I> is an older work
written by the University's long-time Director of Information.
<P>
Special Collections & Archives holds many other materials
about the University's history than those listed here, some of which are also located in the general collection, as indicated by their call numbers. These include publications such as the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/"<I>Gem
of the Mountains</I></a>, agricultural bulletins, historical photographs,
archival records and manuscripts.
<P>Buildings on campus, and a bit of their history, are listed <a href="/special-collections/uibuildings.html">here</a>. A chronological timeline of historic events is <a href="/special-collections/uitimeline.html">here</a>.
<P>
Those items with unspecified call numbers can be found in the general stacks as well as in Special Collections.
