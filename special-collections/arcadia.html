	<p>The University of Idaho Library is excited to announce the publication of a new book capturing the history of the University of Idaho. Written by Professor of History Katherine G. Aiken and Head of Special Collections and Archives Erin Passehl Stoddart, this pictorial volume features over 200 photographs from UI Library Special Collections and Archives. The book also features a foreword written by UI President Chuck Staben. </p><p>The scope of the book encompasses both the long history of the university and new images from the last thirty years. Chapters focus on buildings on the Moscow campus, regional centers, and extension offices; academic departments and degrees; Vandal athletics; student life; and university organizations. The book builds on two previously published histories of the University of Idaho: The Beacon of Mountain and Plain by Rafe Gibbs and This Crested Hill by former state historian Keith Petersen.    </p>
