              <h1>Finding Aids</h1>
              <p><i>Finding Aids</i> are collection guides written in-house to assist with finding information in our research collections, giving fuller descriptions than can be found in our basic online catalog descriptions.  While a few published bibliographies for our Special Collections of library materials are available (such as <i>Scottiana Idahoensis</i> for our Sir Walter Scott Collection), most of our finding aids are <i>inventories</i> to our manuscript and archives collections. Each of these inventories describes the subject content and arrangement of our research collections in depth, usually including summaries of the contents of each collection, and often including detailed lists of folder titles within each box of papers. Photographs are often cataloged in our local databases, with some now available as Digital Collections. </p>

		<p>Each individual collection has a title and number, which are used to organize and reference the collection. Number prefixes show to which Collection group a particular archival, manuscript or photograph collection is assigned.  For example, MG 10 stands for Manuscript Group 10, WILLIAM EDGAR BORAH, 1865-1940.</p>

        <p><b>UG</b> signifies <b>University Group</b>, for University Archives records and documents.</p> 
        <p><b>PG</b> signifies <b>Photograph Group</b>, for for Historic Photograph collections.</p>
