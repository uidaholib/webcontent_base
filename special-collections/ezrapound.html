              <h1>Ezra Pound in the University of Idaho Library</h1><a name="return"></a>
              <p>One of Idaho's most famous, or infamous, native sons, Ezra Pound's
literary reputation was founded half-a-world away, in London,
Paris, and Rome. Born in Hailey, Idaho, in October of 1885, the
son of a federal land officer who -- eighteen months later --
returned to the East with his family, Pound became one of the
founders of Modernism in poetry. Although he never returned to
Idaho, he retained a sense of &quot;westerness&quot; that led
him to break with established canons of society and flee to Europe
in 1908.
</p>
              <p>Promoter and provocateur, Pound proceeded, with T. S. Eliot and
others, to reshape the world of poetry. In France, he met Gertrude
Stein, who quipped, in <I>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</I>
(NY, 1933. p. 246): &quot;He was a village explainer, excellent
if you were a village, but if you were not, not.&quot; Later,
his enthusiasm for radical economic theories led him to embrace
Italian fascism. As a result, he was imprisoned after WWII in
a mental hospital in Washington, D.C. Returning to Italy, he died
there in 1972.
</p>
              <p>The following year, the Pound collection at the University of
Idaho was established at the Library. Pound's daughter, the Princess
Mary de Rachewiltz, presented a number of her father's works to
the collection. She wrote that her father &quot;was very proud
of his connection with [Idaho] and I think you will find affectionate
and amused references to it throughout his writings.&quot; In
honor of her father, the Princess has continued to donate privately
published books on Pound and his circle to the Library's collection.
</p>
              <p>The Pound collection has grown over the years, particularly as
a result of the flood of new works at the time of the Pound Centennial.
In 1991, the library acquired, through funds provided by the Library Associates
of the University of Idaho Library, one of two existing manuscripts
of American poet Vachel Lindsay's 1930 essay on Ezra Pound and
Senator Borah, which he had written as a columnist for the <I>Spokesman-Review</I>.
</p>
              <p>The Ezra Pound Collection at the University of Idaho Library contains
nearly 400 volumes, many of them first editions, of Pound's publications
of poetry, criticism, and translations, and works about him, his
friends and foes.
</p>
              <p>Eleven volumes of <I>Ezra Pound's Poetry and Prose: Contributions
to periodicals</I> (1991), have been added to the University of
Idaho Library's Ezra Pound Collection through the generosity of
the Library Associates. This special collection of significant
resources for the study of Idaho native Ezra Pound is substantially
enhanced by this major addition. The indexed volumes include facsimiles
of over 2000 individual articles, essays, poems, and other pieces
from a wide range of rare or obscure publications.
</p>
              <p>The Ezra Pound Collection is located in the Department of Special
Collections and Archives on the Library's ground floor. Materials
in the non-circulating Pound Collection can be identified through the Library's<A HREF="/"> 
on-line catalog</A>. 
Each has the prefix POUND.
