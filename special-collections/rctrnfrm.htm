<hr WIDTH="100%">
 The Records Transfer Form provides a simple, efficient mechanism for
the transfer of permanently useful records to the University Archives.
Archival records are those which document the policies and procedures of
the University of Idaho and its staff. These records may include correspondence,
minutes, memoranda, ledgers, photographs, maps, computer files, and other
forms of primary documentation. The transfer of permanently valuable records
to the Department of Special Collections and Archives is authorized in
the Faculty-Staff Handbook (6540). Additional guidance may be found in
the Administrative Procedures Manual (65.00)
<p>As a public agency, the University of Idaho has a unique responsiblity
for the maintenance of certain records for the long-term. Not only are
the actions of University staff and officials subject to inquiry; but the
contributions of faculty, staff and students to the people of the State
of Idaho are less likely to be overlooked if adequate contemporary records
are maintained.
<p>Efficient office practice requires that materials of transitory or momentary
significance should not be inter-filed with materials of permanent long-term
utility. At the end of each year, non-current records (usually those over
five years of age) should be transferred to the Archives if of permanent
value (or to the wastebasket if of transitory value). Transitory materials
for most offices include invoices, vouchers, IDG's, travel forms, computer
printouts, and informational photocopies.
<p>Each group of records having a common filing system or organization
should be described on a separate form. The original order of the records
is extremely important for all future uses of the records; please make
sure that records are placed in the boxes in the same order that was maintained
in the file cabinet, and that the boxes are sequentially numbered and the
original folder headings retained.
<p>Upon arrival in the archives, records are appraised for their permanent
value, recorded in an accession register, and shelved to await processing.
During processing the records are returned to their original arrangement
if that has been disrupted, and inventoried, reboxed and refoldered into
acid-free containers and folders, weeded of extraneous materials and duplicates,
and prepared for research use. A copy of the completed inventory is returned
to the office for future reference.
<p>Offices may telephone reference requests to the Archives. Researchers
using records in the Archives are required to register, identify the nature
of their research, take extreme care of the physical materials they are
given to examine, and request permission to publish or quote from the records.
In accord with state, federal and university regulations, some material
is not available to researchers without special permission.
<p>If you have questions about archival records and record-keeping, please
call the Department of Special Collections and Archives (5-0845) or send
