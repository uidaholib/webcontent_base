    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('abc')" style="font-weight: normal;">What is a copyright?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='abc' style="display:none;">A copyright is a form of intellectual property protection, arising from the Constitutional mandate that there must
          be some sort of limited monopoly for authors and creators in order to further the purpose of promoting the progress
          of science and the useful arts. Copyright law, therefore, attempts to strike a delicate balance between the interests
          of the creators and the interests of the public in accessing and using their work.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('def')" style="font-weight: normal;">What can be copyrighted? What cannot?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='def' style="display:none;">Copyright protection extends to all original works of authorship, including literary, musical, dramatic, pictorial,
          graphic, sculptural, sound recordings, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works. It does not extend to general
          facts and ideas, nor does it protect works produced by federal government employees when the work in question is
          created within the scope of their normal employment duties.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('ghi')" style="font-weight: normal;">How do I copyright my work?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='ghi' style="display:none;">Actually, it happens automatically. As soon as your original work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression, it
          is automatically fully protected by copyright. There are just two requirements: originality and fixation.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('jkl')" style="font-weight: normal;">How do I register my copyright? How much does it cost?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='jkl' style="display:none;">It costs $45 to register your copyright, which you do by filling out certain forms with the U.S. Copyright Office.
          The forms with instructions can all be
          <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/register/">found online</a>.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('mno')" style="font-weight: normal;">Does a work have to be published to be copyrighted?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='mno' style="display:none;">No, unpublished works are fully protected (in some ways, more protected, at least as to first publication rights)
          by copyright. That would mean, for example, that an old published letter may have long ago entered the public domain,
          while an unpublished letter of the same vintage might still enjoy copyright protection. However, a provision in
          the 1976 Copyright Act, provides that, beginning December of 2002, unpublished works will enter the public domain
          as soon as their creator has been deceased for seventy years.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('pqr')" style="font-weight: normal;">How long does a copyright last?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='pqr' style="display:none;">According to the Constitution, it is supposed to last a "limited time," but that limited time has grown considerably
          over the years. As of our last Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998, the term of copyright is now the life of the
          author plus seventy (70) years. If it an anonymous work or a work that belongs to a company, for example, the term
          is ninety-five (95) years from publication or one hundred twenty (120) years from creation, whichever is shorter.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('stu')" style="font-weight: normal;">What is the public domain?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='stu' style="display:none;">A work that is in the public domain may be freely used without any copyright issues. This category includes:
          <ul>
            <li>works with expired or lost copyright;</li>
            <li>works not copyrightable by nature (i.e. ideas, facts, titles, etc.);</li>
            <li>works produced by a federal government employees in the course of their job;</li>
            <li>works clearly donated to the public domain; and</li>
            <li>works published in the United States prior to 1923.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('vwx')" style="font-weight: normal;">If a work is out of print, does that mean it's no longer copyrighted?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='vwx' style="display:none;">Unfortunately, no. It just means you may have a harder time finding the copyright holder and perhaps a stronger case
          for fair use.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('zyA')" style="font-weight: normal;">Are there any concise, authoritative resources that can help determine when a particular publication might be free
          of copyright protection?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='zyA' style="display:none;">The U.S. Copyright Office issues an ongoing series of
          <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/">Copyright Circulars</a> that are intended to demystify certain aspects of copyright law. They are frequently revised
          and therefore an excellent source of current information.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('BCD')" style="font-weight: normal;">What is fair use?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='BCD' style="display:none;">Fair use refers to an exemption in the Copyright Act that can allow use without permission in some cases. There are
          four factors that must be considered along the way. You can read more about this in the
          <a href="basics/fairuse.html">fair use section</a>.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('EFG')" style="font-weight: normal;">If I'm copying something for an educational purpose, isn't that fair use?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='EFG' style="display:none;">It depends. Copying a copyrighted work for educational purposes doesn't automatically make that copying fair use.
          Fair use can only be determined on a case-by-case basis, which takes into account the balance of the four factors.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('HIJ')" style="font-weight: normal;">What if I need to copy more than would be permitted under fair use?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='HIJ' style="display:none;">If none of the other copyright exceptions apply, then you will need to
          <a href="teaching/permission.html">secure permission</a> from the copyright owner before you use the material.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('KLM')" style="font-weight: normal;">My request for permission was denied by the copyright owner. What can I do now?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='KLM' style="display:none;">You must NOT use a work if permission has been refused by the copyright holder. You can attempt to negotiate use
          in further correspondence or pay a licensing fee, where possible. Above all else, have an alternative to the material
          or curtail your use to comply with fair use principles.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('NOP')" style="font-weight: normal;">What if my permission request was denied but now I believe fair use or a specific provision of the copyright law
          applies? Am I disadvantaged because I already requested permission?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='NOP' style="display:none;">Previous payment of a fee or even outright denial of permission does not preclude you from exercising your rights
          under the copyright act. You can still employ an appropriate specific provision or the fair use provision and there
          is no presumption against you for having asked permission.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('QRS')" style="font-weight: normal;">What if there is no response?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='QRS' style="display:none;">Lack of response does not translate into a passive grant of permission to use. If your proposed use exceeds all provisions
          of the law, including fair use, you probably need to direct your students to a link to the work, find another work
          to use, or modify your proposed use to fit within fair use.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('TUV')" style="font-weight: normal;">What if I can't find current contact information for the copyright holder? For example the publisher is out of business
          or the author is deceased.</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='TUV' style="display:none;">Such situations present the problem of a work whose copyright holder cannot be located, despite reasonable efforts.
          The U.S. Copyright Office has recognized this problem, calling such works
          <a href="basics/orphan.html">orphan works</a>. Educators must make individual decisions concerning their use of such works, including evaluating
          the risk of liability. Those who proceed with their use should document and preserve their efforts to locate the
          copyright holder.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('WXY')" style="font-weight: normal;">Can I copy a printed journal article for my students?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='WXY' style="display:none;">Yes, distribution of multiple copies of an article for classroom use can be a fair use. Allowance of this copying
          is expressed in the statute, but a
          <a href="http://copyright.columbia.edu/fair-use-checklist">fair use analysis</a> is needed to determine whether fair use applies to any particular set of circumstances surrounding
          a use.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('Zab')" style="font-weight: normal;">Can I download a digital copy of an article and post it to my Blackboard site?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='Zab' style="display:none;">Fair use applies to the use of digital as well as print versions of copyrighted works. For digital articles, however,
          you will need to restrict access to only those students enrolled in the course and limit duration of an article's
          availability. A
          <a href="http://copyright.columbia.edu/fair-use-checklist">fair use analysis</a> will also need to be conducted for each article you'd like to post on the web site.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('cde')" style="font-weight: normal;">Can I download a PDF of an article that is licensed by the library and post it to my class web site?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='cde' style="display:none;">Any use of copyrighted works made available by a license agreement through the University of Idaho Library must first
          comply with the terms of that license. These agreements often do NOT allow copying PDF files and reposting them
          onto another website or a personal Blackboard page. Frequently, though, you can make articles available through
          direct durable links.</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('fgh')" style="font-weight: normal;">If an article is freely available online, is it protected by copyright?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='fgh' style="display:none;">Most likely. Copyright protection is automatically assigned to all new works as soon as they are fixed in a tangible
          medium. Materials presented online may be protected by copyright even if they are freely and openly available and
          do not display a copyright statement or symbol notice ("&copy;").</div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('ijk')" style="font-weight: normal;">Can I copy chapters from a textbook and distribute them to my students?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='ijk' style="display:none;">Generally, this is NOT a fair use. The market for the textbook is directly affected by this activity. Students who
          would otherwise be expected to purchase the book no longer need to and the publisher is deprived of sales in their
          primary market. </div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('lmn')" style="font-weight: normal;">Can I show a video in my class without permission from the copyright owner?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='lmn' style="display:none;">Yes. Section 110 of U.S. Copyright Law permits showing a lawfully acquired video in the classroom. </div>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="javascript:InsertContent('opq')" style="font-weight: normal;">What is the TEACH Act?</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <div id='opq' style="display:none;">The TEACH Act is a revision of the U.S. Copyright Act which allows instructors to perform or display copyrighted
          works in a distance education setting. The Act has many potential advantages for the use of digital technology
          in teaching. In order to take advantage of these benefits, however, instructors, technologists, and institutions
          must meet numerous detailed requirements. For more information, see the section devoted to the
          <a href="teaching/virtual.html#TEACH">TEACH Act</a>.</div>
